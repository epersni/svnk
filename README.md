# svnk
This is a clone of the famous gitk application. But this runs in a ncurses based TUI (much better than a window application if you ask me!) and it browses subersion commits instead of git commits.

Svnk was created to be compliant with old computers, since if you are stuck with subversion, you are likely to be stuck with old an old Linux system). This version compiles perfectly with on a Fedora 12 system! Here are the antique dependencies I used:

* g++ 4.4.4
* Boost 1.39
